# **E-Commerce Web Application**

This is a full-stack e-commerce web application that allows users to browse items, add them to a cart, and proceed to payment. The frontend is built using **ReactJS** and **Bootstrap** for responsiveness, while the backend utilizes **NodeJS** and **ExpressJS** for API creation, state management, and routing. **Redux** is used for managing global state, and custom databases store item details and user selections.

## **Features**

- **Browse Items**: Users can view a list of available items.
- **Add to Cart**: Items can be added to the cart, and the state is updated dynamically using **Redux**.
- **View Cart**: Users can view selected items, along with payment details on a separate page.
- **Responsive Design**: The app is responsive across different devices, built with **Bootstrap**.
- **Custom Backend**: The app communicates with a custom-built database using APIs created with **NodeJS** and **ExpressJS**.
- **State Management**: **Redux** is used to manage the global state across components.
- **Routing**: **React Router** handles the navigation between different pages.
